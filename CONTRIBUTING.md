# DENT Project Governance
This document is a supplementary document to the DENT TSC Charter, which can be found [here](https://dent.dev/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2020/02/DENT-Project-Technical-Charter-1-31-2020.docx.pdf).

### Voting Members
Voting members of the DENT TSC are

1. A representative appointed by each member of the DENT Fund ("the Directed Fund") of the Linux Foundation.
2. A nominated contributor.

### TSC Nomination and Succession

Any proposal for additional members of the TSC may be submitted by raising the issue at a TSC meeting. New TSC members are accepted or rejected by majority vote of the TSC.

A member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such member decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC shall confirm or reject such nomination by a vote.  In the event that the departing member's nomination for successor is rejected by vote of the TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to continue nominating successors until one such successor is confirmed by vote of the TSC.  If the departing member fails or is unable to nominate a successor, the TSC may nominate one on the departing member's behalf.

Voting TSC membership is presumed to be retained by the individual even if they change employers.  The TSC may take action to ensure that organizational stakeholder representation not become severely disproportionate, for example by urging an organization that loses its sole TSC representative to nominate a new member, or to limit the total number of members from any one organization if too many members all move to the same organization.
